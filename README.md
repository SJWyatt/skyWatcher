# SkyWatcher
**An automated aircraft annotation system for my backyard.. or anywhere really**

## Description
SkyWatcher is designed to do one thing: Automate the task of capturing aircraft images along with annotations. Why? Firstly, I live in the approach path to MSP. Secondly, I love airplanes, and lastly I really like exploring robotics, machine learning and computer vision topics. The end goal is to be able to build a detector/classifier someday that can reliably determine what type of aircraft is being observed through visual recognition alone. To do that I need a lot of training samples and although I'm no stranger to hand annotation (https://github.com/froohoo/Inference) I didn't really want to do that again. Plus I have always been intrigued by opportunites to generate annotated data without the labor.

## Operation

### Capture Video (Step 1)
SkyWatcher's video capture setup is based in large part on the excellent tutorial provided by Adrian Rosebrock [located here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/04/15/live-video-streaming-over-network-with-opencv-and-imagezmq/). It uses Ã˜MQ to transoport images captured by a raspberry pi zero W. I liked this idea because the zero W is cheap ($5 at Micro Center) and I already had a webcam to use with it. For my setup, I assembled everything into a used Ferro Rocher chocolate box ($7.39 at Target). Bonus: You get to eat the chocoloates inside. Everything is precision attached with hot glue.
